I am a Ph.D. candidate in Political Science at Ohio State University. My research lies at the intersection of international political economy, gender politics, and political methodology. In broad terms, I investigate the linkages between economic globalization and workers’ experiences in the domestic labor market.  I explore my research agenda through a mix of large-N quantitative analysis, causal inference, survey experiments, Bayesian statistics, and text analysis.  My dissertation, Three Essays on the Political Economy of International Trade and the Domestic Labor Market, focuses on firms’ and workers’ responses to economic globalization and the diffusion of social responsibility norms.

Before joining Ohio State, I earned my B.A. and M.A. in Political Science from Seoul National University, South Korea. My work has been supported by the Fulbright Fellowship, the [Presidential Fellow at OSU](https://gradsch.osu.edu/presidential-fellowship), and other grants including the APSA Centennial Center Research Grant and the APSA Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grant.
