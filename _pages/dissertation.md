How does economic globalization affect workers’ experiences in the domestic labor market, and how do their perceptions of globalization shape their attitudes toward economic policy? I investigate the linkages between economic globalization and workers’ experiences in the domestic labor market, with a special focus on the political consequences of economic and gender inequality in the labor market. I use computational methods, such as text analysis, survey experiments, and causal inference methods to test my claims.

##  Dissertation 

My dissertation, *Three Essays on the International Trade and the Domestic Labor Market*, focuses on firms' and workers' responses to economic globalization and the diffusion of socially responsible norms. To assess these relationships, I employ a multimethod approach by combining natural language processing (NLP) and causal inference methods.



#### Protectionism Reconsidered: Economic Insecurity, Social Identity, and the Gender Gap in Trade Attitudes

Using decomposition analysis, a survey experiment, and structural topic models, I examine how economic insecurity, such as the experience of gender discrimination for women and trade shocks for men, explains the gender gap in trade attitudes. 

#### Obfuscating Social Responsibility: Global Performance Indicators and Labor Upgrading in Global Production Networks  

Employing the difference-in-differences method, I investigate how Global Performance Indicators (GPIs) induce firms' compliance by obfuscation in supply chains and its impacts on workers' experiences in the labor market.

#### Measuring Women’s Economic Rights 

I create a new measure to capture the latent heterogeneity of gender inequality in the labor market.
